Read time = 0.00 sec. (0.00 ticks)
Version identifier: 20.1.0.0 | 2020-11-10 | 9bedb6d68
Found incumbent of value 1.000000 after 0.00 sec. (0.00 ticks)
Tried aggregator 2 times.
MIP Presolve eliminated 4 rows and 1 columns.
Aggregator did 1 substitutions.
All rows and columns eliminated.
Presolve time = 0.02 sec. (0.01 ticks)

Root node processing (before b&c):
  Real time             =    0.02 sec. (0.01 ticks)
Parallel b&c, 8 threads:
  Real time             =    0.00 sec. (0.00 ticks)
  Sync time (average)   =    0.00 sec.
  Wait time (average)   =    0.00 sec.
                          ------------
Total (root+branch&cut) =    0.02 sec. (0.01 ticks)
